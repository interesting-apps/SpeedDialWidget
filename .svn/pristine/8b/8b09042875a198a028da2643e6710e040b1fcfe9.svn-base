Making phone calls - the most basic functionality expected from a mobile phone - is itself too long and tedious process. We have to open the Phone app, select the contact, select the number of the contact that we have to call and then finally dial the number. If we have to do this once or twice a day - its bearable. But if we have to do the same thing for a number of times in the same day, it goes from tedious and tiring to annoying. Ever imagined how easy it would be, if making calls could be at our finger tips, and all we have to do is just enter some easy to remember shortcut number for each contact we make frequent calls to and dial?

Well, SpeedDial Widget is an app thats come to make that imagination into reality. Just add the widget on your home screen, assign easy to remember speed dial numbers for the contacts and start dialing. Thats it. Yeah, thats right! No need to open any app, skim through the enormous lsit of contacts and decide on which number to dial. Just enter the shortcut number on the home screen only and dial.
